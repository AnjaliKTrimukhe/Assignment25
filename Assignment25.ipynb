    "3)What are the signs that a function is a generator function?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "When Python parses the def statement, it decides if the code is defining a generator or a function. If the code contains a yield expression, then it is a generator."

    "Ans:\n",
    "Yield is used to return from a function without destroying the states of its local variable and when the function is called, the execution starts from the last yield statement. Any function that contains a yield keyword is termed a generator. "

    "contrast between the two.\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "map may be microscopically faster in some cases (when you're NOT making a lambda for the purpose, but using the same function in map and a listcomp). List comprehensions may be faster in other cases and most (not all) pythonistas consider them more direct and clearer.\n",
